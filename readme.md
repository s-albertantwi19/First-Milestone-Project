# The Sunny Isles of The Seychelles

Project 1 - Samuel Albert-Antwi

## The Sunny Isles of The Seychelles

This project was designed to encapsulate a country which is very dear to me. With my mother hailing from the Seychelles and having lived in the Seychelles, I thought this would be a great way to display the beauty of the archipelago for those less familiar with the Seychelles Islands.

### About 

The Seychelles is an island paradise archepelago located in the Indian Ocean

# User Experience UX
## User Stories

The aim of the Seychelles Information page was to shine light on a lesser known island paradise with a humble population of < 100,000 people. With images of the island paradise on each page, the user should feel emerged in sunshine and therefore inclined to explore the archepelago nation further.

The primary focus of the site is to give a taste of the rich culture of the Seychelles. 

# Design

The website has been created across 4 pages - the initial page being a responsive photo gallery displaying the beaches, the mountainous regions and then the urban landscape.

The chosen colour scheme has been selected to reflect a warm, tropical feeling.

# Deployment

To deploy the project I have utilised Github Desktop and Github

## My Repository

I created a new Github repository and cloned the repository using Github Desktop to develop locally in Visual Studio Code.

Whilst coding in Visual Studio Code, I ensured to save my development at each interval and regularly commit to the respository with commit messages on Github Desktop - this was the preferred method of developing as my Github account had failures when linking to Visual Studio Code. Had this not been an issue, I would have utilised the terminal to make my git commit statements and git push commands.
