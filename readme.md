# The Sunny Isles of The Seychelles

Project 1 - Samuel Albert-Antwi

## The Sunny Isles of The Seychelles

This project was designed to encapsulate a country which is very dear to me. With my mother hailing from the Seychelles and having lived in the Seychelles, I thought this would be a great way to display the beauty of the archipelago for those less familiar with the Seychelles Islands.

### About
